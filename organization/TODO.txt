1. Build NGINX stack.
    -- Serve HTMX/CSS off of disk.
    -- Passthru API access to the Golang application.
2. Build Golang app.
    -- Save preambles for users and GFs
    -- Manage various different token passthrus.
    -- Make queries to the user/GF database, return GF attributes
    -- Run attributes and user tokens thru modelpool.
    -- Return strings to frontends.

I want NGINX to perform most of the passthru work to various different Golang API instances for the headers, which in turn go speak to a modelpool.
